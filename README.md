A script that displays a summary of the status of Veeam jobs for Office 365

This script has been adapted by me to display the summary of the last Veeam backup job for Office 365 in order to integrate it in Nagios or Centreon.

This one takes into account the status of the job, its state and its execution date.

A counter also allows the simplified display of the number of jobs in OK, CRITICAL or WARNING.
